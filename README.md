Since the mid-19th century, the landscape of the Sacramento – San Joaquin River Delta has been heavily altered through human modifications. Artificial levees for flood control, debris from hydraulic mining, deepwater shipping channels and water exports have all fundamentally altered the form and function of the Delta. To characterize the hydrodynamics of the Delta under natural conditions (prior to modifications of the Delta’s geometry and hydrology), a bathymetric-topographic digital elevation model (DEM) was created to represent the Delta circa the early 1800s. Primary inputs to the elevation modeling include 2D historical Delta channels and land cover data from previous historical ecology mapping efforts (Whipple et al. 2012) along with elevation data from historical sources including the US Coast Survey hydrographic sheets and early rivers surveys. Novel techniques were developed to work with historical data, including methods to interpolate between sparse historical soundings, infer the depths of non-navigable channels from channel width, and convert historical tidal datums to modern fixed datums. The resulting 2-meter resolution digital elevation model covers the Delta’s historical channels, tidal wetlands, adjacent non-tidal freshwater wetlands, and upland transitional areas below 25 feet in elevation.
