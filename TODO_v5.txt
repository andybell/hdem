TODO list for HDEM v5 code base

1. rm unnecessary/broken tools from repo v5

	still need to remove TIN2ASCII once it is added to pyt

2. convert tbx's to single python toolbox in order to have them under version control
	TIN2ASCII.py - may need to adjust the number/locations of the tiles since extant was extended for Suisun

3. add relevant R script/functions to repo. Near180.R, spline?

	Added near 180 to repo. Not sure how yet to interpolate the conveyance.

4. sys subprocess call to read near table to r to find nearest points on the banks
	
	Finished. python now calls near180 r script to gerenerate non - perfect cross sections. Check with steve about how this is going 
	to impact the conveyance. 

5. Turn near points to polyline ZM, adding formula for depths OR generate points along line (parabola points)

	Important!!!! 
	
	1. python? or R? 
	
	2. create general formulata for parabola shape/depth
	
	3. calculate x-section area for historical soundings
	
	4. figure out how to create point/vertices along cross section
	
	
6. Interpolate conveyance between known cross sections to determine depths.

7. Figure out how to deal with the junctions, stream network? or mesh? Need both physical junctions as well as the
	figuring out how to add conveyance areas together.

8. Add more functionality to TIN to group display (symbology, dealing with group name issue, etc). Lower priority
	since the tool basically works
