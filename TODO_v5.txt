TODO list for HDEM v5 code base

1. rm unnecessary/broken tools from repo v5

	still need to remove TIN2ASCII once it is added to pyt

2. convert tbx's to single python toolbox in order to have them under version control
	TIN2ASCII.py - may need to adjust the number/locations of the tiles since extant was extended for Suisun

3. add relevant R script/functions to repo. Near180.R, spline?

4. sys subprocess call to read near table to r to find nearest points on the banks

5. Turn near points to polyline ZM, adding formula for depths OR generate points along line (parabola points)

6. Interpolate conveyance between known cross sections to determine depths.

7. Figure out how to deal with the junctions, stream network? or mesh? Need both physical junctions as well as the
	figuring out how to add conveyance areas together.

8. Add more functionality to TIN to group display (symbology, dealing with group name issue, etc). Lower priority
	since the tool basically works
